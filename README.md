### About the app

With this app you can add insights dynamically and group them into clusters by dragging the highlights with your cursor.
Each insight is displayed as sticky notes(aka highlights) with different colours generated randomly. You can also move highlights between different clusters, edit them, delete them and save them in the browser's localStorage.

### to run the code using 'npm':

Use 'npm start' to run the app in development mode. 
This app uses local host memory to store the insights.
